# Thesis-Optoelectronics-and-simulation-
Matlab code of computational part of my thesis work (Non-linear perturbated laser system).



What is reported in this repo are some of the tons of the Matlab code I implemented for this thesis project.
MZmodeloffasafunction is a function that calculates and plots the simulated signal once are given the variable parameters of the physical system.
In this case the physical system was an enhanced laser self mixing measurement system with a Mach-Zehnder Interfermeter as offline filter.
Same is true for MZmodelinasafunction simulating system with a MZI as inline filter.
